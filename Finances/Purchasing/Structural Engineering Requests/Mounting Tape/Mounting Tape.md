# Mounting Tape Purchase

## Request Motive

> Structural Engineering requests that double-sided mounting tape be used to line the inner edges of Foundation 2. This tape will reduce the work necessary to install plastic Curbell rolls onto Foundation 2 which the robot will rely on to be able to properly navigate around the airport. The current solution requires the use of double sided magic tape but there are doubts that tape may not be able to hold the platstic roll for very long. Test Lab 3 raised these doubts. The use of this tape will be first tested in Test Lab 4 and then most likely used on Foundation 2. The requested tapes are available at Home-Depot. 

## Product Options

Two options were found at Home Depot:

1. [Option 1](https://www.homedepot.com/p/3M-Scotch-1-in-x-1-60-yds-Permanent-Double-Sided-Clear-Mounting-Tape-410DC-SF/203936785)

1. [Option 2](https://www.homedepot.com/p/3M-1-in-x-1-52-yds-Permanent-Double-Sided-Indoor-Mounting-Tape-214DC-SF/202287313)

## Foundation 2 Calculations

* Straight inner edges are 19.5 inches.

* Foundation 2 Inner Section edge has a radius of 6.5 inches. Circumference of a circle is 2\pir. So, 2 * \pi * 6.5 = 40.84. This calculation includes both semi-circle curved edges.

* Foundation 2 Outer Section edge has a radius of 7 inches. Circumference of a circle is 2\pir. So, 2 * \pi * 7 = 43.98. This calculation includes both semi-circle curved edges.

## Individual Option Cost Analysis

1. Option 1

   * Cost per tape is $4.97. It's length is 1.60 yds or 4.8 ft. $4.97 / 4.8 ft = 1.04 $/ft.

   * Foundation 2 needs 162.82 inches or 13.57 ft of mounting tape. 13.57 ft / 4.8 ft = 2.83 ~ 3 rolls of tape.

   * The width of the tape is 1 inch while the width of Foundation 2 is 3/4 inch. Some leftover remains so 2 rolls may be sufficient for this project. The leftover can be used on the edges where the backstage will be at.

1. Option 2

   * Cost per tape is $4.27. It's length is 1.52 yds or 4.56 ft. $4.27 / 4.56 ft = 0.94 $/ft.

   * Foundation 2 needs 162.82 inches or 13.57 ft of mounting tape. 13.57 ft / 4.56 ft = 2.98 ~ 3 rolls of tape.

   * The width of the tape is 1 inch while the width of Foundation 2 is 3/4 inch. Some leftover remains so 2 rolls may be sufficient for this project. The leftover can be used on the edges where the backstage will be at.

## Chosen Option

Option 2 is cheaper. No significant differences were observed between the two options in terms of material quality. Option 1 is clear and the other is white. Color does not seem to matter so Option 2 will be chosen. Two rolls of mounting tape is 2 * $4.27 = $8.54. Three rolls of mounting tape is 3 * $4.27 = $12.81. Two rolls seem sufficient and using scrap is a main goal of this project. This product must be checked at Home Depot before a decision can be made to buy it or not.

## Cost

* Two rolls of Option 2 : $8.54
