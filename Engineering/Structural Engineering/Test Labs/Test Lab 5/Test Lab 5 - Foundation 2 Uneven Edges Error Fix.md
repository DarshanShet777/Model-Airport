# Test Lab 5 - Foundation 2 Uneven Inner Edges Error Fix

## Materials:

* (1) Test Lab 3 Setup

* (2) Scrap 22" x 28" Artskills White Poster Board

* (1) School Glue

## Hypothesis:

> Using simple school glue and poster board should fix the problem.

## Instructions:

1. Take a piece of poster board strip (random length like 2" x .75") and apply glue on one side.

1. Apply the poster board strip with the glued side facing the the side of the cardboard test setup from Test Lab 3.

1. Wait one day.

1. Analyze the side and observe if the Curbell plastic sheets stay against the cardboard efficiently. Document the results.

## Results:

> Success. The poster board strip creates a flat surface for which the Curbell strips can be applied on. Some gaps are present in between the strip and the cardboard setup but that could be filled with spacing material. If necessary, strips could be divided up and connected together with tape to allow flexibility.
