# Test Lab 4 - Foundation 2 Uneven Inner Edges Error Fix

## Materials:

* (3+) Scrap 1/4" x 15 3/4" x 40 1/2" Double Corrugated Cardboard

* (2) Scrap 1/4" Wide Curbell Plastics Clear Translucent Sheet Rolls

* (1) Duct Tape

* (2+) 10-32 x 1" pan head Phillip's (PHP) machine screws (Hillman Stainless Steel Home Screw Assortment #130214)

## Hypothesis:

> Using reverse folded duct tape applied to the cardboard edges with with Curbell roll on top, this setup should be able to last for long periods of time as duct tape is strong.

## Instructions:

1. Take a piece of duct tape (Duct tape width  x  2") and reverse fold the piece so that the adhesive part is facing outwards. Create two more of these pieces and apply to the test cardboard made in Test Lab 3. 

1. Apply the Curbell piece of plastic against the tape.

1. Wait one day.

1. Analyze the side and observe if the Curbell plastic sheets stay against the cardboard efficiently. Document the results.

## Results:

> The duct tape failed to hold the plastic piece in place for more than 24 hours.
