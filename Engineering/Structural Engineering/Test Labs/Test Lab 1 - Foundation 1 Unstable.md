# Test Lab 1

## Materials:

* Foundation 1

* Scrap 59" Aluminum Refrigerator LED Bracket

* Flat workbench

* Thin sized objects for support, Ex. rulers

## Hypothesis:

> Adding a third horizontal aluminum bracket in the center of Foundation 1 will reduce or eliminate the reciprocating motion.

## Instructions:

1. Place the scrap aluminum bracket in the middle of the workbench. See the "Aluminum Bracket Setup View 1" and "Aluminum Bracket Setup View 2" image for details. Use thin sized objects to support the desired position of the bracket.

1. Place Foundation 1 on top of the scrap aluminum bracket. The scrap bracket should be in the center when Foundation 1 is placed.

1. Test the center of Foundation 1 by pushing down or tapping with your finger.

## Results:

> Hypothesis passed. Adding a third horizontal aluminum bracket in the center of Foundation 1 does reduce or eliminate the reciprocating motion. This bracket should be added.
