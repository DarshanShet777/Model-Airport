# Test Lab 3 - Foundation 2 Uneven Inner Edges Error Fix

## Materials:

* (3+) Scrap 1/4" x 15 3/4" x 40 1/2" Double Corrugated Cardboard

* (2) Scrap 1/4" Wide Curbell Plastics Clear Translucent Sheet Rolls

* (1) IPG 1 3/8" Masking Tape

* (2+) 10-32 x 1" pan head Phillip's (PHP) machine screws (Hillman Stainless Steel Home Screw Assortment #130214)

* (1) Pushp Enterprises Captain Bright Nickel Electro Plated M.S. Pins

## Hypothesis:

> Even with edge layer errors, adding the tape and the Curbell plastic sheet roll should not pose a problem for the robot to move around the airport.

## Instructions:

1. Create a test model as shown in "Test Lab 3 Testbed" images folder. Take three sheets of scrap cardboard and stack them using screws. Add IPG tape to all sides of the testbed. One side should be flat while the other sides can be crooked. The flat side will be the control group. Add trimmed Curbell plastic sheet roll to the sides and fix it into the tape using the Captain pins. 

1. Analyze the control group and the other sides and observe if the Curbell plastic sheets stay against the cardboard efficiently. Document the results.

## Results:

> The crooked sides can hold the robot in place however there are chances in the long run that this setup may fail. The flat side was able to hold the sheet in place but some material like glue may need to be added to keep the pins in place as they tend to loosen up a bit.
