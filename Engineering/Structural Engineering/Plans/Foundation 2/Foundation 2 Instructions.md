## Instructions:

1. Transfer all materials to workbench and organize them.

1. Create Foundation 2 as shown in the Layout plan and the Picturized plan. Wood glue also needs to be used to join the various sections together where necessary. If a section cannot be completed due to lack of a material, use scrap and try to complete it with what is given. Some thought may need to be given on how it should be done. If this occurs, take pictures of how it was done for future needs.

1. When Foundation 2 is complete, install the Foundation 2 onto the Columns and use appropiate screws to lock it in place.
