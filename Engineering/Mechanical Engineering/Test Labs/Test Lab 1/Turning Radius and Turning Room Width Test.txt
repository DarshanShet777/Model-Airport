# Turning Radius and Turning Room Width Range Test

## Materials:

* (1) Robot

* (2) 8 7/8" x 11 7/8" Colored Construction Paper

* (1) Pencil Wood

* (1) Camel Metal Compass

* (1) 3M Scotch Matte Finish Magic Tape 

## Hypothesis:

> The robot should be able to turn in a 6" radius without any difficulty. Also, the turning room width should be less than or equal to twice the width of the robot (8").

## Instructions:

1. Tape two sheets of construction paper side by side. It does not matter whether the shorter side or longer side of both sheets are taped together.

1. Create a 6" and 7" arc on a combined sheet of construction paper. Straight edges may be added on the ends of the arc to extend the robot path. See "Construction Paper Setup" images for details.

1. Test the robot by moving it on the line. The airplane rod should be directly above the line when the robot is moving.

1. Perform previous step multiple times to ensure accuracy.

1. Record the result.

## Result:

> The hypothesis was proved false. The robot was able to manage the 7" turn only. The 6" turn proved to be tight for the robot as the wheels kept slipping to stay on path. The turning room range of the robot was right. 4" is needed from the radius to the center for the robot to stay clear of the columns. 2" is needed from the radius to beyond for the robot to stay clear of the columns past the radius.
