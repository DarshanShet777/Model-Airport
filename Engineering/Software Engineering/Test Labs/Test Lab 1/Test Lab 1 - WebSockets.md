1. Test remotely by uploading to Heroku and opening up webpage. Ensure that it works.

1. Make sure to document results and determine whether this will solve current direct connection issue.

## Results

> WebSocket Example: [Link](https://intense-woodland-10331.herokuapp.com/). Unfortunately, the project code may have to be changed due to how Heroku is structured. WebSocket examples found online do not work well with Heroku [Tutorial](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/node-websockets).
