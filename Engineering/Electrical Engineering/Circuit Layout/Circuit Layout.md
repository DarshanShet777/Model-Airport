# Circuit Layout

#### Note to Structural Engineering

This plan should not be used to determine check posts location on the model airport. This plan only gives a rough idea as to how many sensors there are and where they may be located.

## Materials

| Components | Quantity | Notes|
| --- | --- | --- |
| IR LED Emitters| 3 | |
| IR LED Receivers | 2 | |
| 22 AWG Wires | >10 ft.| |
| M/F Jumper Cables | 6 | |
| Check posts | 3 | get from Structural Engineering |


## Notes

* Be careful to use IR receivers appropiately because inventory only has 3 of them. 1 IR receiver will be used for the robot.
