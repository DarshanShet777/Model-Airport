# EE Note

All circuit diagrams will be made through [Falstad Circuit Simulator Applet](https://www.falstad.com/circuit/). This applet allows circuits to be saved as images and/or text files. This makes editing and saving files very easy. Other online services require sign-up and/or are too difficult to use as a beginner.
