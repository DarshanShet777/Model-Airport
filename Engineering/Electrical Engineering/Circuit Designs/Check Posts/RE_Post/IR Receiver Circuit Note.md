# IR Receiver Circuit Note

The two nearby switches shown in the circuit are actually representing the IR receiver which was not available in the applet. The switch closest to the 3.3V power source represents when light is shown on the IR receiver. The second switch is actually an analog switch with open and closed resistances and represents the IR receiver during operation.
