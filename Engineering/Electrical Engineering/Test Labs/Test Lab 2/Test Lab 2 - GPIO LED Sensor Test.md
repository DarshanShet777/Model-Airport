# Test Lab 2 - IR Sensor Test

### Hypothesis

> Testing IR sensor so that they may be used with sensor posts on the model airport. HIGH and LOW signals should be created.

### Materials:

* Multimeter

* 170 point breadboard black

* 3mm LED - any color

* photoresistor

* IR sensor 2 pin

* 10K resistor

* 65K resistor

* M/F jumper cables or wires with stripped ends

### Instructions

1. Follow the instructions on this [tutorial](http://www.learningaboutelectronics.com/Articles/Dark-activated-light-circuit.php). Get the circuit to work. Use 65K resistor as 100K. Use 10K as 330 Ohm resistor. Use 2N2222 transistor as 2N3094. Use multimeter to check connections of necessary.

1. Turn circuit off. Replace with photoresistor with IR sensor.

1. Find a TV remote control or IR emitting electronic. Check the remote with the camera app on any smartphone. Pointing the remote at the camera should and pressing any button should cause a purple flash on the screen of the smartphone.

1. Turn circuit on and use a remote control to activate the IR sensor. The LED should blink or stay off.

### Results:

> Success. The LED blinked when a IR remote was pointed at the IR sensor. The IR sensor works and how to use one is understood. This sensor can be used for the sensor posts.
