# Test Lab 1 - GPIO LED Test

### Hypothesis

> Testing GPIOZero library with a simple LED circuit. Link to setup provided below.

### Materials:

* Raspberry Pi

* 170 point breadboard black

* 3mm LED - any color

* 1K resistor

* M/F jumper cables

### Instructions

1. Follow the instructions on this [tutorial](https://thepihut.com/blogs/raspberry-pi-tutorials/27968772-turning-on-an-led-with-your-raspberry-pis-gpio-pins). However, use GPIO 17 to light up the LED. Use the GPIOZero library to power the LED.

1. Make sure to save the code inside the Test Lab 1 folder for future reference.

### Results:

> Success. LED blinked on/off.
