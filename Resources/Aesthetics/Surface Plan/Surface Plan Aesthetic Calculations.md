# Aesthetics Proposal and Calculations

## Taxiway Design

* Proposed Width: 2"
   * Video Proof: ([Air Mauritius Airbus A350's Inaugural Flight to Mumbai Airport](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiXzyK4lYk4))
   * Video Proof: ([Impatient Speedbird Pilot !!!! BA 777-200, Medevac Learjet 45 departing St. Kitts Airport](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uhsx6V57HtQ))
   * TDG Group 7 Definition. Adjusted to 2". FAA standard proof: AC 150/5300-13A (Pg. 124)
   * 82 ft * 12 in = 984 in -> 984 in / 500 scale = 1.968 in ~ 2.0 in
   * Taxiway will look similar to one used in St. Kitts Airport but with edge lights and solid edge lines

## Runway Design

* Proposed Width: 3.5"
   * Video Proof: ([FIRST ARRIVAL AIRBUS A330NEO AIR MAURITIUS | 3B-NBU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMwm9KzwcnQ))
   * 150 ft runway width. Adjusted to 3.5" FAA standard proof: ASO Airfield Standards Quick Reference (Pg. 6) or AC 150/5300-13A (Pg. 14)
   * 150 ft * 12 in = 1800 in -> 1800 in / 500 scale = 3.6 in ~ 3.5 in
   * Runway is normal in design. See Figure A-6 in FAA Document AC 150/5340-30J for details.
