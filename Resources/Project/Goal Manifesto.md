# Model Airport Goals:

1. Use scrap wherever possible. Scrap reduces waste and saves money for future projects.

1. Use GitHub as the one and only place for all documentation.

1. Use Discord as the one and only place for all communication except when inviting members to the project.

1. Break this project into stages which will allow for efficient construction.

1. Check with advisors at all times to ensure construction of airport goes efficiently for all non-CS related development.
