# Model Airport Goals:

1. Use scrap wherever possible. Scrap reduces waste and saves money for future projects.

1. Use GitHub as the one and only place for all communication and documentation.

1. Break this project into stages which will allow efficient construction.

1. Check with advisers at all times to ensure construction of airport goes efficiently for all non-CS related development.
