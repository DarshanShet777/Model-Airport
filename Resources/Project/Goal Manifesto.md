# Model Airport Goals:

1. Use scrap wherever possible. Scrap reduces waste and saves money for future projects.

1. Use GitHub as the one and only place for all communication and documentation.

1. Break this project into stages which will allow efficient construction.

1. Find and check with consultants for advice on construction especially for all non-CS related engineering development.
